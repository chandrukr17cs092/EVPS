## This folder contains data set configuration example

If you want to run single simulation you need to specify config.json like file, when starting simulator. 
This file consists of multiple objects to describe: vehicles, routes, general settings, map settings and trip settings.
File config.json is here for plain example of single simulation, where 6 emergency vehicles drive throught 6 different routes at different simulation time step.

If you want to run parallel simulations you need specify config-parallel.json like file, when starting simulator in parallel mode.
